# Welcome to Lee's Cake Shop,

Lee's Cake Shop is a command line based program created to handle data automation which runs on a mock terminal on Heroku.

This program was designed to help a business minimize product wastage, keep track of sales and profit rates as well as the total combined profit. It generates the data based on the user input and updates into a Google sheets worksheet.

## How to use

* The user runs the program on the app and type 'sales' to enter new sales numbers.
* The sales numbers must be a collection of 10 numbers separated by commas. The computer will verify if it was entered correctly and request the user to enter the sales numbers again if needed.
* The program will then generate a new wastage number based on the previous stock and each rate calculation which will be displayed on the screen. Every 2 sales registered the computer will then calculate a new stock number to minimize the wastage.

### Future features

* A monthly favorites feauture where the program tracks the most sold cakes of each month.
* A reset function which allows the user to delete the existing data using the app.


## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!
